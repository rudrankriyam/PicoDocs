# PicoDocs


A Swift package for importing and converting documents for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Audience

Designed for chat clients and LLM server applications that utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation ([RAG](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/)).

## Key Features

PicoDocs supports and processes a variety of document formats:
- **File Types**: PDF, DOCX, HTML, Markdown, and more.
- **Export Options**: Convert documents to HTML, Markdown, and JSON formats for LLM compatibility, with embedded and referenced images.
- **Content Cleanup**: Utilizes Readability to clean HTML content, enhancing focus on the main content similar to Safari's Reader View.
- **Multiple Sources**: Reads local files and iCloud files.

## How It Works

There are two main steps: fetching and parsing.

### Fetching
- Load files from disk or download files from iCloud or the web.
- Support loading all documents within local or iCloud directories as child documents.

### Parsing
- Convert original file contents to LLM-readable formats, such as Markdown, HTML, or CSV.
- PicoDocs can choose the most optimal LLM-readable format for each original file type. For example, Excel sheets will be exported to CSV unless overridden by the developer.

## Supported File Types

- PDF
- ePub
- DOCX
- HTML/XHTML
- XLSX
- TXT
- RTF
- MD
- Webloc

## Installation

To add PicoDocs to your Swift project, use:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/picoMLX/PicoDocs.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

## Code Example

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://electrek.co/2025/01/14/top-10-best-selling-evs-us-2024/")!
let doc = try PicoDocument(url: url)
try await doc.fetch()
try await doc.parse()
print(doc.exportedContent)
```

## Setup for Apps

### Info.plist Configuration
Add necessary import identifiers to your `Info.plist`.

For sandboxed apps:

### Networking Permissions
Enable `Outgoing Connections (client)` for network access.

### File Access
Ensure the `User Selected Files` capability is set to `read-only` or `read/write`.

Refer to the [example app](PicoDocsExample/) for detailed guidance.
